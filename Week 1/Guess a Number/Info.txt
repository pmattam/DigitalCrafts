step1 - implementing a guess-the-number game where the player has to try guessing a secret number until he gets it right. For now, you will "hard code" the secret number to 5 (just set it to five like secret_number = 5). You will prompt the player to enter a number again and again, each time comparing his input to the secret number. To to that, you will need to write a while loop. If he guesses correctly, you will print "You win!", otherwise, you will prompt for a number again.

step2 - Give High-Low Hint

step3 - Randomly Generated Secret Number

step4 - Limit Number of Guesses

step5 - Play Again
