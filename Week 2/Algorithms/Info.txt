algorithm1.py - 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

algorithm2.py - A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

algorithm3.py - Write a program in Python that prints out all lines of 99 Bottles of Beer all the way down to zero.

Example: “99 Bottles of beer, take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall”

However, for numbers that are multiples of 7, replace beer with Miller

And for numbers that are multiples of 5, replace beer with Lite beer

Lastly, for numbers that are multiples of 7 and 5, replace beer with Miller Lite

You are welcome to take creative liberty with the beer brands, or replace it with soft drinks.
