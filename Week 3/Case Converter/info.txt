Writen a function caseConvert that accepts two arguments. The first is a string, the second is type. 
If the type is "camelcase" then convert the string to 
camelcase (each word except the first is capitalized, no spaces). 
If type is "snakecase" then convert the string to 
snakecase (each word is separated by a - and all lowercase). 
As a bonus, accept a string or an array. If it's an array, use .join and proceed accordingly.

def caseConvert(str, conversionType):

 //Your code here!!

 return convertedStr
